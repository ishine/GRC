You may want to use up-to-date scripts of RETURNN toolkit, rather than the RETURNN originally included in this repository.

In this case, follow these steps:

(1) Install returnn toolkit by un-captioning & re-executing the script {root_dir}/03_git_clone_returnn.sh 

   # If successfully installed, the directory will be {root_dir}/returnn

(2) Copy {root_dir}/returnn_modification/TFNetworkLayerMine.py into the directory {root_dir}/returnn/

(3) Modify {root_dir}/returnn/TFNetworkLayer.py script to properly import the script TFNetworkLayerMine.py 

   # Refer to the 9817-th and the 9821-th line in TFNetworkLayer.py script)
   # Just import TFNetworkLyaerMine.py in the same way as these lines.
